# HP H150 Auto-Switch Bluetooth (Windows + Android)

I put this entire setup together because I was so tired of constantly disconnecting and reconnecting my HP H150 earbuds between my laptop and my phone.
The earbuds don’t support true multipoint, but with this setup, they behave almost exactly like they do.

Here’s the method I personally use every day. It works smoothly, switches automatically, and doesn't require me to tap anything.

What This Setup Does (from my experience)
- When I open YouTube, Spotify, or play literally anything on Windows → the earbuds instantly connect to my laptop.
- When I get a phone call or start playing a video on my phone → they instantly jump back to my phone.
- No manual disconnecting.
- No Bluetooth menu.
- No delays.

This is the closest you can get to multipoint without buying new earbuds.
